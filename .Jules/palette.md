## 2025-05-14 - Tooltips and ARIA labels for Sidebar Navigation
**Learning:** Icon-only buttons and collapsed sidebars without tooltips can be frustrating for users and are less accessible. Adding tooltips provides immediate clarity, and ARIA labels ensure screen readers can describe the action.
**Action:** Always provide tooltips for icon-only buttons and collapsed navigation items. Use Ant Design's `Tooltip` component for a consistent feel.

**Learning:** Subtle transitions (like sidebar width) and standard visual affordances (like red asterisks for required fields) significantly elevate the professional feel of an application.
**Action:** Use Tailwind `transition-all` with appropriate durations for state changes. Use standard UI patterns like `*` for required fields instead of text labels.
