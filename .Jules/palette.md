## 2025-05-22 - Accessibility and Clarity in Collapsible Sidebars
**Learning:** Collapsible sidebars often sacrifice clarity for space. Users may forget what icons represent when the sidebar is collapsed. Missing ARIA labels on toggle buttons makes the interface less accessible to screen reader users.
**Action:** Always provide Tooltips for icons in collapsed sidebars and include descriptive ARIA labels for icon-only toggle buttons.
