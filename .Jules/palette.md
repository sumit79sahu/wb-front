## 2026-02-04 - Sidebar Accessibility and Clarity
**Learning:** Icon-only buttons in the sidebar (especially when collapsed) lack immediate clarity and accessibility for screen readers and mouse users.
**Action:** Always provide `Tooltip` components for icon buttons and ensure they have descriptive `aria-label` attributes. This improves UX for both keyboard/screen-reader users and mouse users who might not recognize the icons.
